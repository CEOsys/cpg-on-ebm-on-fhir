### History

#### Version v0.5.0

- Update to FHIR 5.0.0-snapshot3
- Updated IG fhir.base.template version to 0.4.0
- Changed IG id to ebm-cpg.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de
- made RecommendationPlan.extension[cpg-partOf] mandatory
- fixed cpg extensions slice names
- updated readme
- removed terminology dependency from sushi-config.yaml

#### Version v0.4.0

- use of "Recommendation" as the base profile for a recommendation is now
  obligatory (as opposed to using only RecommendationPlan profile
  instances). Recommendation is a collection of individual
  RecommendationPlan resources, which in turn define the different
  pieces of a single recommendation.
- made slicing of RecommendationPlan.goal closed
- PlanDefinition.action.selectionBehavior: now disallowing codes that do
    not required at least one action to be taken, i.e. the following codes
    from ActionSelectionBehavior are now disallowed:
    - any ("from zero to all")
    - all-or-none
- changed drug vocabluary to SNOMED CT, added ATC and RxNorm
- added laboratory observation ValueSet
- disallowing RecommendationAction.timing.code because it can be expressed
    using the timing.repeat field, which is far more flexible

#### Version v0.3.5

Fix/selection-behavior-invariant (#5)
