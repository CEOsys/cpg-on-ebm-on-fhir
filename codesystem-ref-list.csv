The personas identified in this code system are defined based on the WHO recommendation for [Classifying health workers](https://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf). This recommendation uses codes from the [International Standard Classification for Occupations](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm) but defines several additional categories of health workers. In addition, the codes in that recommendation are focused on health workers, so codes for patient and care partner personas need to be considered as well. Where a code from the ISCO exists, it is used. Where a WHO recommended health worker category is used, a code is constructed beginning with a W. Where a code is introduced by this implementation guide, it is constructed beginning with a C. Note that the content is incomplete, pending a computable representation of the WHO recommendations.","ValueSet/cpg-common-persona"

LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/vs-assessment,ValueSet/vs-assessment-scales,ValueSet/vs-observations"

The ""S"" stands for the extent of the applied systematic approach in the development process of a guideline.     Each class thus stands for a specific methodological concept that must be presented in a way that is comprehensible to the users.     The choice of class is based on the question of how much effort is appropriate and feasible.     The need for legitimacy for the implementation of the guideline (convincing the target group) must be taken into account.
